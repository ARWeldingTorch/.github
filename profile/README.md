## Project Statement and Goals


## Wyatt Short-term Milestones
- Setup OpenCV and Numpy
- Display camera
- Calibrate camera
- Extract pixel data 
- Filter out background
    - Observe color behavior
- Filter out noise
- Isolate clusters
    - Explore SciLearn
- Track/record center points
- 

## Wyatt Long-term Milestones
- Successfuly identify/isolate color
- Identify individual shapes/objects
- Log critical point pixel coordinates
- Prove reliability using depth camera through testing
- Model planes of joint and calculate parameters (angle, center, etc.)
- Combine 2D pixel location with depth information
- Verify reliability of 3D tracking through testing
- Allow better calculation through multiple photos
- Communicate location information to robotic arm
- Process/communicate details of weld to arm processor (color, writing, etc.)
-

## Wyatt Project Statement
The goal of this desgin is to provide reliable code that utilizes color, shape, 
and depth information from singular photos to route the welding armin an 
optimized way, minimizing the amount of required training for operators and 
allowing welders to more effectively control details of the weld.
